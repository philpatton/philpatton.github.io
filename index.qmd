Phil is a PhD candidate in the [Marine Mammal Research Program](https://www.mmrphawaii.org) at the [Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology](https://www.himb.hawaii.edu), and a [NOAA QUEST Fellow](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/content/quantitative-ecology-and-socioeconomics-training-quest-program) with the [Cetacean Research Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/pacific-islands/science-data/whale-and-dolphin-surveys-pacific-islands) at the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center.

For his dissertation, he's researching ways to improve stock assessments of non-migratory dolphins in Hawaiʻi. This includes [automating photo-identification](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.14167) of these animals, [understanding](mbc-pres.html) how these automated tools [interact with capture-recapture models](https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.14436), and estimating demographic parameters using cutting edge methods in capture recapture.

He did his master's with [Krishna Pacifici](https://cnr.ncsu.edu/directory/krishna-pacifici/) at North Carolina State University, where he studied ways to improve estimates of species distribution, particularly when [species interact](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10530-022-02825-3) and when the data contains sampling errors.
