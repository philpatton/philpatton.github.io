Please find here any notebooks that I may have thought would be of general interest. For now, these mainly consist of my attempts to port standard ecological models to [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html), a Python library for doing Bayesian analysis. 

# PyMC

There are many valuable tools for fitting hierarchical models in ecology. These tools are typically R libraries, such as [unmarked](https://rbchan.github.io/unmarked/), or programs called from R, such as [JAGS](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/roylebook/) or [Stan](https://fukamilab.github.io/BIO202/09-C-occupancy-models.html). There are relatively fewer examples of how to fit these models in Python. While most ecologists, and arguably statisticians, use R, there are some benefits to using Python generally. For example, despite ecology being a lucrative industry, some of us might have to pivot to another field where Python may be more common. Besides, Python is widely used for machine learning, which is increasingly applied in ecology.  

In the PyMC notebooks, I try to demonstrate how to use PyMC to train the most common hierarchcial models in ecology. For this, I have drawn considerable inspiration from @royle2008, @kery2011, and @hooten2019, oftentimes simply porting their code, ideas, and analyses. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate PyMC's core features, and highlight its strengths and weakenesses. The PyMC notebooks are somewhat sequential, with earlier notebooks explaining more basic features.
