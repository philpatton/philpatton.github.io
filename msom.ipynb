        "In this notebook, I explore fitting community occupancy models in PyMC. Community occupancy models are a multi-species extension of standard occupancy models. The benefit of these models is that, by treating each species as a random effect, they can estimate occupancy and detection more precisely than single species models. Further, through data augmentation, they can estimate the richness of the supercommunity, that is, the total number of species that use the study area during the surveys.\n",

In this example, $n=99$ species were detected at the $J=50$ sites over the $K=11$ surveys in New Hampshire. The BBS occurs on routes across the US. This dataset represents one route.\n"

I also augment the species names in the `coords` dict, such that we can still use the `dims` argument in the multivariate normal.

The only difference with this `logp` is that it uses a `ZeroInflatedBinomial` distribution under the hood, rather than a Bernoulli, and uses the parameter $\\Omega$ to account for the row-level inflation. \n"
