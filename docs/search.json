There are relatively fewer examples of how to fit these models in Python. While most ecologists, and arguably statisticians, use R, there are some benefits to using Python generally. For example, despite ecology being a lucrative industry, some of us might have to pivot to another field where Python may be more common. Besides, Python is widely used for machine learning, which is increasingly applied in ecology.\nIn this notebook, I demonstrate how to fit static site-occupancy models in PyMC, a Python library for doing Bayesian data analysis. PyMC has many virtues, including a user-friendly interface, and a direct linkage to the ArviZ library, which has functions for summarizing MCMC output.",

    "text": "Estimating parameters with PyMC\nNext, I use PyMC to train the occupancy model with the simulated data. First, similar to JAGS and Stan, the model must be specified using the PyMC syntax. This is done using a context manager in Python, essentially, a with statement. This creates a Model object.\n\nwith pm.Model() as constant:\n\n    # priors for the detetion and occurrence probabilities\\\n    psi = pm.Uniform('psi', 0, 1)\n    p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1)\n\n    # likelihood for the summarized data\n    pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial('y', p=p, psi=psi, n=visit_count, \n                            observed=y_summarized)\n\nIn JAGS, the prior for \\(p\\) would be specified as p ~ dunif(0, 1). The PyMC equivalent is p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1). This could, alternatively, be specified as p = pm.Uniform('detection probability', 0, 1).\nFor the likelihood, I use PyMC’s built-in ZeroInflatedBinomial distribution. We tell PyMC that this is an observed random variable by supplying data to the observed argument.\nPyMC has handy tools for visualizing the model.\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(constant)\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest possible occupancy model. Random variables appear as unshaded ellipses while data appears shaded. Notice the ‘200’, which states that there are 200 observations (sites) of this random variable.\n\n\n\n\nNow I can sample from the posterior. Again, I use the context manager, this time referring to the model by name. It’s typical to name the output with idata because, by default, PyMC returns an object of class InferenceData from the Arviz package.

I could write the model in terms of the latent occurrence state \\(z_j.\\) The NUTS sampler, however, does not jive with discrete latent states. As such, PyMC will assign it to a binary Gibbs sampler by default, which works, albeit painfully slowly.\nSince I am impatient, I instead use the marginalized version of the model, that is, a model that does not include the discrete latent states. To do this in PyMC, I use the CustomDist class. This requires, first, defining the log probability of the distribution, logp, given the data and it’s parameters. We can write logp using the likelihood of the occupancy model, \\[\nP(\\mathbf{y}_j)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j \\; + \\; (1 - \\psi_j),   & \\text{if } \\mathbf{y}_j = \\mathbf{0}\\\\\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j,  & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1) = \\prod_j p_{j,k}^{y_{j,k}} (1-p_{j,k})^{(1-y_{j,k})}.\\) To do this in PyMC, I rely on the pm.math.switch function, which is similar to ifelse() in R or np.where().\n\n# likelihood for y data\ndef logp(x, p, psi):\n    '''Computes the log-likelihood for an occupancy model\n\n    Args: \n        x: (site_count x visit_count) array with binary detection data\n        p: (site_count x visit_count) array of probabilities\n        p: site_count vector of probabilities\n    '''\n    \n    bern = (p ** x) * ((1 - p) ** (1 - x))\n    bern_prod = pm.math.prod(bern, axis=1)\n    \n    res = pm.math.switch(\n        x.sum(axis=1) &gt; 0,\n        bern_prod * psi,\n        bern_prod * psi + (1 - psi)\n    )\n    \n    return pm.math.log(res)\n\nThen, I simply provide this function as an argument to the CustomDist class in our PyMC model.\n\nwith pm.Model() as marginal:\n\n    # occurrence process \n    # priors \n    beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    \n    # linear model\n    mu = beta0 + beta1 * x\n    psi = pm.Deterministic(\"psi\", pm.math.invlogit(mu))\n\n    # detection process\n    # priors\n    alpha0 = pm.Normal('alpha0', mu=0, sigma=2)\n    alpha1 = pm.Normal('alpha1', mu=0, sigma=2)\n\n    # linear model\n    nu = alpha0 + alpha1 * w\n    p = pm.Deterministic('p', pm.math.invlogit(nu))\n\n    # likelihood\n    pm.CustomDist(\n        'y',\n        p,\n        psi,\n        logp=logp,\n        observed=y,\n    )\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(marginal)\n\nExecutableNotFound: failed to execute PosixPath('dot'), make sure the Graphviz executables are on your systems' PATH\n\n\n&lt;graphviz.graphs.Digraph at 0x168255990&gt;\n\n\n\nwith marginal:\n    marginal_idata = pm.sample()\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [beta0, beta1, alpha0, alpha1]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 4 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:03&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(\n    marginal_idata,\n    var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'],\n    lines=[(\"beta0\", {}, [beta0_true]), (\"beta1\", {}, [beta1_true]), \n           ('alpha0', {}, [alpha0_true]), ('alpha1', {}, [alpha1_true])]\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naz.summary(marginal_idata, var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nbeta0\n-0.747\n0.245\n-1.203\n-0.282\n0.004\n0.003\n3312.0\n2743.0\n1.0\n\n\nbeta1\n2.794\n0.396\n2.076\n3.540\n0.007\n0.005\n3468.0\n3222.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha0\n1.403\n0.275\n0.889\n1.914\n0.005\n0.004\n2667.0\n2807.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha1\n-3.091\n0.382\n-3.818\n-2.396\n0.007\n0.005\n2678.0\n2718.0\n1.0",

I could write the model in terms of the latent occurrence state \\(z_j.\\) The NUTS sampler, however, does not jive with discrete latent states. As such, PyMC will assign it to a binary Gibbs sampler by default, which works, albeit painfully slowly.\nSince I am impatient, I instead use the marginalized version of the model, that is, a model that does not include the discrete latent states. To do this in PyMC, I use the CustomDist class. This requires, first, defining the log probability of the distribution, logp, given the data and it’s parameters. We can write logp using the likelihood of the occupancy model, \\[\nP(\\mathbf{y}_j)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j \\; + \\; (1 - \\psi_j),   & \\text{if } \\mathbf{y}_j = \\mathbf{0}\\\\\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j,  & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1) = \\prod_j p_{j,k}^{y_{j,k}} (1-p_{j,k})^{(1-y_{j,k})}.\\) To do this in PyMC, I rely on the pm.math.switch function, which is similar to ifelse() in R or np.where().\n\n# likelihood for y data\ndef logp(x, p, psi):\n    '''Computes the log-likelihood for an occupancy model\n\n    Args: \n        x: (site_count x visit_count) array with binary detection data\n        p: (site_count x visit_count) array of probabilities\n        p: site_count vector of probabilities\n    '''\n    \n    bern = (p ** x) * ((1 - p) ** (1 - x))\n    bern_prod = pm.math.prod(bern, axis=1)\n    \n    res = pm.math.switch(\n        x.sum(axis=1) &gt; 0,\n        bern_prod * psi,\n        bern_prod * psi + (1 - psi)\n    )\n    \n    return pm.math.log(res)\n\nThen, I simply provide this function as an argument to the CustomDist class in our PyMC model.\n\nwith pm.Model() as marginal:\n\n    # occurrence process \n    # priors \n    beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    \n    # linear model\n    mu = beta0 + beta1 * x\n    psi = pm.Deterministic(\"psi\", pm.math.invlogit(mu))\n\n    # detection process\n    # priors\n    alpha0 = pm.Normal('alpha0', mu=0, sigma=2)\n    alpha1 = pm.Normal('alpha1', mu=0, sigma=2)\n\n    # linear model\n    nu = alpha0 + alpha1 * w\n    p = pm.Deterministic('p', pm.math.invlogit(nu))\n\n    # likelihood\n    pm.CustomDist(\n        'y',\n        p,\n        psi,\n        logp=logp,\n        observed=y,\n    )\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(marginal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith marginal:\n    marginal_idata = pm.sample()\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [beta0, beta1, alpha0, alpha1]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 4 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:03&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(\n    marginal_idata,\n    var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'],\n    lines=[(\"beta0\", {}, [beta0_true]), (\"beta1\", {}, [beta1_true]), \n           ('alpha0', {}, [alpha0_true]), ('alpha1', {}, [alpha1_true])]\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naz.summary(marginal_idata, var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nbeta0\n-0.742\n0.239\n-1.206\n-0.312\n0.004\n0.003\n3726.0\n3164.0\n1.0\n\n\nbeta1\n2.792\n0.383\n2.091\n3.510\n0.006\n0.005\n3527.0\n2715.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha0\n1.398\n0.277\n0.909\n1.950\n0.006\n0.004\n2228.0\n2401.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha1\n-3.079\n0.398\n-3.787\n-2.309\n0.008\n0.006\n2479.0\n2586.0\n1.0",

I could write the model in terms of the latent occurrence state \\(z_j.\\) The NUTS sampler, however, does not jive with discrete latent states. As such, PyMC will assign it to a binary Gibbs sampler by default, which works, albeit painfully slowly.\nSince I am impatient, I instead use the marginalized version of the model, that is, a model that does not include the discrete latent states. To do this in PyMC, I use the CustomDist class. This requires, first, defining the log probability of the distribution, logp, given the data and it’s parameters. We can write logp using the likelihood of the occupancy model, \\[\nP(\\mathbf{y}_j)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j \\; + \\; (1 - \\psi_j),   & \\text{if } \\mathbf{y}_j = \\mathbf{0}\\\\\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j,  & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\] where \\(P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1) = \\prod_j p_{j,k}^{y_{j,k}} (1-p_{j,k})^{(1-y_{j,k})}.\\) To do this in PyMC, I rely on the pm.math.switch function, which is similar to ifelse() in R or np.where().\n\n# likelihood for y data\ndef logp(x, p, psi):\n    '''Computes the log-likelihood for an occupancy model\n\n    Args: \n        x: (site_count x visit_count) array with binary detection data\n        p: (site_count x visit_count) array of probabilities\n        p: site_count vector of probabilities\n    '''\n    \n    bern = (p ** x) * ((1 - p) ** (1 - x))\n    bern_prod = pm.math.prod(bern, axis=1)\n    \n    res = pm.math.switch(\n        x.sum(axis=1) &gt; 0,\n        bern_prod * psi,\n        bern_prod * psi + (1 - psi)\n    )\n    \n    return pm.math.log(res)\n\nThen, I simply provide this function as an argument to the CustomDist class in our PyMC model.\n\nwith pm.Model() as marginal:\n\n    # occurrence process \n    # priors \n    beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    \n    # linear model\n    mu = beta0 + beta1 * x\n    psi = pm.Deterministic(\"psi\", pm.math.invlogit(mu))\n\n    # detection process\n    # priors\n    alpha0 = pm.Normal('alpha0', mu=0, sigma=2)\n    alpha1 = pm.Normal('alpha1', mu=0, sigma=2)\n\n    # linear model\n    nu = alpha0 + alpha1 * w\n    p = pm.Deterministic('p', pm.math.invlogit(nu))\n\n    # likelihood\n    pm.CustomDist(\n        'y',\n        p,\n        psi,\n        logp=logp,\n        observed=y,\n    )\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(marginal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith marginal:\n    marginal_idata = pm.sample()\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [beta0, beta1, alpha0, alpha1]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 4 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:03&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(\n    marginal_idata,\n    var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'],\n    lines=[(\"beta0\", {}, [beta0_true]), (\"beta1\", {}, [beta1_true]), \n           ('alpha0', {}, [alpha0_true]), ('alpha1', {}, [alpha1_true])]\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naz.summary(marginal_idata, var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nbeta0\n-0.746\n0.242\n-1.191\n-0.303\n0.004\n0.003\n3314.0\n2562.0\n1.0\n\n\nbeta1\n2.807\n0.391\n2.058\n3.518\n0.007\n0.005\n3096.0\n2848.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha0\n1.398\n0.265\n0.905\n1.891\n0.005\n0.004\n2836.0\n2719.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha1\n-3.081\n0.379\n-3.756\n-2.342\n0.007\n0.005\n2754.0\n2454.0\n1.0",

    "text": "In this notebook, I explore fitting closed population capture-recapture models in PyMC. Capture-recapture, at least the Lincoln-Peterson estimator, has been around for almost 100 years. Since then, countless varieties of capture-recapture models have been developed for closed populations (Otis et al. 1978).\nThe basic steps in capture-recapture are: capture several individuals–e.g., via trapping–from the population of interest, mark these animals, then release them. We repeat this process several times, each time noting when we recapture individuals.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Example capture history, where \\(t\\) is the sampling occasion and 1 indicates capture\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividual\n\\(t_1\\)\n\\(t_2\\)\n\\(t_3\\)\n\\(t_4\\)\n\n\n\n\n001\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n002\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n003\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis produces a capture history for each individual, which allows us to estimate the probability of capture and the number of individuals in the population \\(N\\).\n\nModel \\(M_0\\)\n\n# libraries \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pymc as pm\nimport arviz as az\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n\n# hyperparameters \nSEED = 808\nRNG = np.random.default_rng(SEED)\nDRAW_COUNT = 1000\nM = 1500\n\nI explore fitting the simplest closed capture-recapture model, Model \\(M_0,\\) through parameter-expanded data-autmentation (PX-DA, Royle and Dorazio 2008). The idea with PX-DA is to augment the capture histories with \\(M-n\\) all zero capture-histories, where \\(M\\) is a hyperparameter that should be much greater than the true population size \\(N,\\) and \\(n\\) is the total number of individuals that were captured during the study. This allows us to treat the data as a zero-inflated binomial distribution (see below).\n\ndef augment_history(history):\n    '''Augment a capture history with all-zero histories.'''\n    \n    animals_captured, T = history.shape\n\n    # create M - n all zero histories\n    zero_history_count = M - animals_captured\n    zero_history = np.zeros((zero_history_count, T))\n\n    # tack those on to the capture history\n    augmented = np.row_stack((history, zero_history))\n\n    return augmented \n\nTo demonstrate this approach, I use the salamander dataset from Bailey, Simons, and Pollock (2004), as demonstrated in Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 24. These data were collected on two salamander species, the red-cheeked salamander (Plethodon jordani) and the pygmy salamander (Desmognathus wrighti), in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The salamanders were counted in 15m by 15m square plots. In this case, we augment the history by setting \\(M=1500\\) (see above). There were \\(n=92\\) individual red-cheeked and \\(n=132\\) pygmy salamanders captured during the course of the survey.\n\ndef get_history():\n    '''Read, augment, and recombine the salamander histories.'''\n    \n    # read in salamander data \n    sal_data = pd.read_csv('sal_data.csv')\n    \n    # labels for capture history columns \n    col_labs = [f'y{t}' for t in range(1, 5)]\n\n    # subset each dataset before augmenting \n    is_red = sal_data.spp == 0\n    red = sal_data.loc[is_red, col_labs].to_numpy()\n    \n    is_pyg = sal_data.spp == 1\n    pyg = sal_data.loc[is_pyg, col_labs].to_numpy()\n\n    # augment each set separately since they differ in length\n    red_augmented = augment_history(red)\n    pyg_augmented = augment_history(pyg)\n\n    # recombine into one history \n    history = np.concatenate((red_augmented, pyg_augmented))\n\n    return history\n\nhistory = get_history()\n_, T = history.shape \n\n# summarize into binomial data\nhistory_summarized = history.sum(axis=1)\n\nFor this model, I use the pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial class, just as I did in the occupancy notebook. That said, the parameters here are different. First, \\(p\\) represents the probability of capturing a given individual during the survey. Second, \\(\\psi\\) represents a mysterious entity known as the inclusion probability. That is, the probability that an individual from the hyportheitical superpopulation \\(M\\) is included in the popualation of interest \\(N.\\) Then, we can estimate the population size as \\(\\hat{N}=M\\hat{\\psi},\\) or generate posterior draws of \\(N,\\) e.g., \\(N^{(s)} \\sim \\text{Bin}(M,\\psi^{(s)})\\)\nIn this example, I combine the two species into one pm.Model object, making use of coords. That said, the parameters for each species are treated as independent.\n\n# index for each species\nspecies_idx = np.repeat([0, 1], M)\n\n# coordinates identifying parameter each species  \ncoords = {'species': ['red_cheeked', 'pygmy']}\n\nwith pm.Model(coords=coords) as M0:\n\n    # priors for the capture and inclusion probabilities\n    psi = pm.Uniform('psi', 0, 1, dims='species')\n    p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1, dims='species')\n\n    # likelihood for the summarized data\n    pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial(\n        'history', \n        p=p[species_idx], \n        psi=psi[species_idx], \n        n=T,\n        observed=history_summarized\n    )\n    \npm.model_to_graphviz(M0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith M0:\n    M0_idata = pm.sample(DRAW_COUNT)\n\nAuto-assigning NUTS sampler...\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [psi, p]\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 20 seconds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [8000/8000 00:19&lt;00:00 Sampling 4 chains, 0 divergences]\n    \n    \n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(M0_idata);\n\n\n\n\nTraceplots for the salamander \\(M_0\\) model. The red-cheeked salamander is in blue while the pygmy salamander is in orange.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, these plots lack our true parameter of interest: the population size \\(N.\\) We can treat this as a derived quantity, using \\(M\\) and the posterior distribuion of \\(\\psi\\) to generate a posterior for \\(N.\\) Arviz has handy tools for calculating posteriors of derived quantities, which I demonstrate below.\n\n# this does not make a copy of the posterior\npost = M0_idata.posterior\n\n# simulate draws of N using the posterior of psi \nN_samples = RNG.binomial(M, post.psi)\n\n# add our draws back to the idata object, \n# specifying the dimensions of our array (species, chain, draw)\npost['N'] = (post.dims, N_samples)\n\nNow we can look at the traceplots, this time excluding \\(\\psi\\) and looking at \\(N.\\) I also added the estimates from Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 24, although they used a different prior for \\(\\psi.\\)\n\nN_hooten = [229.6, 450.9]\naz.plot_trace(M0_idata, var_names=['p', 'N'], combined=True,\n              lines=[(\"N\", {}, [N_hooten])]);\n\n\n\n\nTraceplots for the salamander \\(M_0\\) model, including \\(N\\).

We can explore this relationship visually by plotting the posterior draws. For a more custom look to the plots, I plot the draws using matplotlib\n\n# stack the draws for each chain, creating a (n_draws, n_species) array \np_samps = np.vstack(post.p.to_numpy())\nN_samps = np.vstack(post.N.to_numpy())\n\n# create the plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(4, 4))\n\n# add the scatter for each species\nlabs = ['Red-backed','Pygmy']\nax.scatter(p_samps[:,0], N_samps[:,0], s=5, alpha=0.05, label=labs[0])\nax.scatter(p_samps[:,1], N_samps[:,1], s=5, alpha=0.05, label=labs[1])\n\n# this removes the opacity for the dots in the legend\nleg = ax.legend()\nfor lh in leg.legend_handles: \n    lh.set_alpha(1)\n\n# update aesthetics \nax.spines.right.set_visible(False)\nax.spines.top.set_visible(False)\n\nax.set_ylabel(r'$N$')\nax.set_xlabel(r'$p$')\nax.set_title('Posterior draws')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nPosterior draws of \\(N\\) and \\(p\\) for both species of salamander.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBailey, Larissa L, Theodore R Simons, and Kenneth H Pollock. 2004. “Estimating Detection Probability Parameters for Plethodon Salamanders Using the Robust Capture-Recapture Design.” The Journal of Wildlife Management 68 (1): 1–13.\n\n\nHooten, Mevin B, and Trevor Hefley. 2019.
