    "text": "In this notebook, I demonstrate how to fit static site-occupancy models in PyMC (Royle and Dorazio 2008, chap. 3). The standard site-occupancy model models binary detection/non-detection data \\(y_{j,k}\\) for repeated surveys \\(k=1,2,\\dots,K\\) at sites \\(j=1,2,\\dots,J.\\) The species is present at the sites when \\(z_j=1,\\) and absent otherwise. We assume that our probability of detecting the species given that the site is occupied is \\(P(y_{j,k}|z_j=1)=p,\\) and zero when the site is unoccupied. The probability of occurrence, which is typically the parameter of interest, is \\(P(z_{j}=1)=\\psi.\\) As such, we can think of this as a zero-inflated binomial model, where \\[\n\\begin{align}\n&y_j \\sim\n\\begin{cases}\n    0,   & \\text{if } z_j = 0 \\\\\n    \\text{Binomial}(K, p),   & \\text{if } z_j = 1\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n&z_j \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(\\psi)\n\\end{align},\n\\] which assumes a constant occurrence probability across sites and a constant detection probability. I start with this simple model, then add site- and visit-level covariates later.",

    "text": "Estimating parameters with PyMC\nNext, I use PyMC to train the occupancy model with the simulated data. First, similar to JAGS and Stan, the model must be specified using the PyMC syntax. This is done using a context manager in Python, essentially, a with statement. This creates a Model object.\n\nwith pm.Model() as constant:\n\n    # priors for the detetion and occurrence probabilities\\\n    psi = pm.Uniform('psi', 0, 1)\n    p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1)\n\n    # likelihood for the summarized data\n    pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial('y', p=p, psi=psi, n=visit_count,\n                            observed=y_summarized)\n\nIn JAGS, the prior for \\(p\\) would be specified as p ~ dunif(0, 1). The PyMC equivalent is p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1). This could, alternatively, be specified as p = pm.Uniform('detection probability', 0, 1). For the likelihood, I use PyMC’s built-in ZeroInflatedBinomial distribution. We tell PyMC that this is an observed random variable by supplying data to the observed argument.

Again, I use the context manager, this time referring to the model by name. It’s typical to name the output with idata because, by default, PyMC returns an object of class InferenceData from the Arviz package.

As you can see, it samples the posterior quickly. I can plot the output using the az.plot_trace(), supplying the true values for \\(p\\) and \\(\\psi\\) for comparison.

In an occupancy model, however, this is only true at sites where the species was never detected, and we have no way of compelling pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial to only consider zero inflation at certain sites.\nAs such, we will now code the model in terms of the discrete, latent \\(z_i\\) state, where \\(z_i=1\\) if site \\(i\\) is occupied and \\(z_i=0\\) otherwise. This is the canonical way to code occupancy models in WinBUGS, JAGS, and NIMBLE (Royle and Dorazio 2008; Kéry and Schaub 2011). The NUTS sampler, however, does not jive with discrete latent states. As such, PyMC will assign a binary Gibbs sampler to z by default, which works, albeit less efficiently than the NUTS sampler. That said, PyMC will assign the other continuous parameters to the NUTS sampler, which is good!\n\nwith pm.Model() as binary_gibbs:\n\n    # occurrence process\n    # priors\n    beta0 = pm.Normal(\"beta0\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n    beta1 = pm.Normal(\"beta1\", mu=0, sigma=2)\n\n    # linear model\n    mu = beta0 + beta1 * x\n    psi = pm.Deterministic(\"psi\", pm.math.invlogit(mu))\n\n    # detection process\n    # priors\n    alpha0 = pm.Normal('alpha0', mu=0, sigma=2)\n    alpha1 = pm.Normal('alpha1', mu=0, sigma=2)\n\n    # linear model\n    nu = alpha0 + alpha1 * w\n    p = pm.Deterministic('p', pm.math.invlogit(nu))\n\n    # occupied / unoccupied state at each site\n    z = pm.Bernoulli(\"z\", psi)\n\n    # [:, None] allows us to multiply a vector across every column of a matrix\n    mu_y = z[:, None] * p\n\n    # the likelihood is now bernoulli conditional on the z state\n    pm.Bernoulli(\"y\", mu_y, observed=y)\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(binary_gibbs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Visual representation of the \\(p(w)\\psi(w)\\) model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mu_y = z[:, None] * p notation may look strange to an R user. This is a trick that’s related to NumPy’s broadcasting rules. Broadcasting allows us to multiply arrays with different dimensions. In this case, we have a vector z that we would like to multiply against a matrix p, such that the first value in z is multiplied against every value in the first row of p, and so on. R does this naturally since it has slightly different broadcasting rules than NumPy. To do this in NumPy, we need to make z a column vector by adding a dummy dimension, hence the [:, None].\n\nwith binary_gibbs:\n    binary_gibbs_idata = pm.sample()\naz.summary(binary_gibbs_idata, var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'])\n\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nCompoundStep\n&gt;NUTS: [beta0, beta1, alpha0, alpha1]\n&gt;BinaryGibbsMetropolis: [z]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 14 seconds.\n/Users/philtpatton/miniforge3/envs/pymc_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/arviz/stats/diagnostics.py:596: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in scalar divide\n  (between_chain_variance / within_chain_variance + num_samples - 1) / (num_samples)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nbeta0\n-0.745\n0.239\n-1.207\n-0.308\n0.005\n0.004\n2805.0\n2765.0\n1.0\n\n\nbeta1\n2.791\n0.394\n2.113\n3.576\n0.007\n0.005\n3054.0\n2837.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha0\n1.396\n0.270\n0.867\n1.864\n0.005\n0.004\n2450.0\n2821.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha1\n-3.087\n0.381\n-3.846\n-2.434\n0.007\n0.005\n2802.0\n2660.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the model recovers the simulated parameters.

Like many other notebooks in this series, it relies on augmenting the detection histories with all-zero histories. These represent the detection histories for species that may use the study site, but were not detected over the \\(K=11\\) surveys. I also augment the species names in the coords dict, such that we can still use the dims argument in the multivariate normal. Mirroring Royle and Dorazio (2008), I augment the history \\(M - n\\) all-zero histories, where \\(M=250\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of species detected during the survey.\n\nThe CustomDist class\nIn the notebooks for closed models, we have relied on the marginalize function from pymc_extras. In my testing, however, this function fails with this model, perhaps because of the the double layers of zero inflation (site occupation, community inclusion). As such, we will have to marginalize the discrete latent state ourselves. To do so, we have to create a custom distribution via PyMC’s CustomDist class.\nCustomDist requires two main inputs: logp and random. The logp is the log probability statement, which is similar to how one might define the likelihood in Stan.

    "text": "In this notebook, I show how to train spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models in PyMC. SCR expands upon traditional capture-recapture by incorporating the location of the traps in the analysis. This matters because, typically, animals that live near a particular trap are more likely to be caught in it. In doing so, SCR links individual-level processes to the population-level, expanding the scientific scope of simple designs.\nIn this notebook, I train the simplest possible SCR model, SCR0 (Royle et al. 2013, chap. 5), where the goal is estimating the true population size \\(N\\). Similar to the other closed population notebooks, I do so using parameter-expanded data-augmentation (PX-DA). I also borrow the concept of the detection function from the distance sampling notebook.\nAs a motivating example, I use the ovenbird mist netting dataset provided by Murray Efford via the secr package in R. The design of the study is outlined in Efford, Dawson, and Robbins (2004) and Borchers and Efford (2008).

Since then, countless varieties of capture-recapture models have been developed for closed populations (Otis et al. 1978).\nThe basic steps in capture-recapture are: capture several individuals–e.g., via trapping–from the population of interest, mark these animals, then release them. We repeat this process several times, each time noting when we recapture individuals.\nThis produces a capture history for each individual, which allows us to estimate the probability of capture and the number of individuals in the population \\(N\\).",

Like many other notebooks in this series, it relies on augmenting the detection histories with all-zero histories. These represent the detection histories for species that may use the study site, but were not detected over the \\(K=11\\) surveys. I also augment the species names in the coords dict, such that we can still use the dims argument in the multivariate normal. Mirroring Royle and Dorazio (2008), I augment the history \\(M - n\\) all-zero histories, where \\(M=250\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of species detected during the survey.\nSimilar to the occupancy notebook, I use a CustomDist to model the augmented history. This accounts for the “row-level” zero-inflation, whereby we know that the species is included in the super community if it was detected along the BBS route.

Like the CJS notebook, I have drawn considerable inspiration from Austin Rochford’s notebook on capture-recapture in PyMC, the second chapter of my dissertation, and McCrea and Morgan (2014).\nAs a demonstration of the JSSA framework, I use the classic European dipper data of Lebreton et al.

    "text": "In this notebook, I demonstrate an approach to model selection in PyMC. To do so, follow the lead of King and Brooks (2008), although not nearly as elegantly. They demonstrate an approach to model selection for a typical suite of closed capture-recapture models. These include the effects of behavior \\(b\\), time \\(t,\\) and individual heterogeneity \\(h\\) on capture probabilities \\(p\\). The eight models considered here are combinations of the three: \\(M_{0},\\) \\(M_{t},\\) \\(M_{b},\\) \\(M_{tb},\\) \\(M_{h},\\) \\(M_{th},\\) \\(M_{bh}\\). The full model, \\(M_{tbh}\\), is\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{logit} \\; p_{it} = \\mu + \\alpha_t + \\beta x_{it} + \\gamma_i,\n\\end{equation}\n\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the average catchability, \\(\\alpha_t\\) is the effect of each occasion on catchability, \\(\\beta\\) is the behavioral effect, \\(x_{it}\\) indicates whether the individual has been previously caught, and \\(\\gamma_i\\) is the individual random effect such that \\(\\gamma_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(0,\\sigma)\\). Formulating the model this way makes the other models nested subsets of the full model.\nLike King and Brooks (2008), I use the the Moray Firth bottlenose dolphin data as a motivating example. Wilson, Hammond, and Thompson (1999) detected \\(n=56\\) dolphins over the course of \\(T=17\\) boat surveys between May and September 1992. They generated the capture-recapture histories by way of photo-identification, which is near and dear to my heart (and my dissertation).\n\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\n\n# libraries \nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pymc as pm\nimport arviz as az\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom pymc.distributions.dist_math import binomln, logpow\n\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.rcParams['axes.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'white'\npal = sns.color_palette(\"Set2\")\nsns.set_palette(pal)\n\n# hyperparameters \nSEED = 808\nRNG = np.random.default_rng(SEED)\n\ndef augment_history(history):\n    '''Augment a capture history with all-zero histories.'''\n    \n    animals_captured, T = history.shape\n\n    # create M - n all zero histories\n    zero_history_count = M - animals_captured\n    zero_history = np.zeros((zero_history_count, T))\n\n    # tack those on to the capture history\n    augmented = np.row_stack((history, zero_history))\n\n    return augmented \n\ndef get_behavior_covariate(history):\n    \n    # note the occasion when each individual was first seen\n    first_seen = (history != 0).argmax(axis=1)\n    \n    # create the covariate for the behavior effect\n    behavior_covariate = np.zeros_like(history)\n    for i, f in enumerate(first_seen):\n        behavior_covariate[i, (f + 1):] = 1\n\n    return behavior_covariate\n\ndef get_occasion_covariate(history):\n\n    _, T = history.shape\n    l = []\n    for t in range(T):\n        oc = np.zeros_like(history)\n        oc[:, t] = 1\n        l.append(oc)\n\n    return np.stack(l, axis=2)\n\ndef sim_N(idata):\n    \n    psi_samps = az.extract(idata).psi.values\n    p_samps = az.extract(idata).p.values\n    not_p = (1 - p_samps)\n    \n    if p_samps.ndim == 1:\n        p_included = psi_samps * (not_p) ** T \n        number_undetected = RNG.binomial(M - n, p_included)\n\n    elif p_samps.ndim == 3:\n        p_included = psi_samps * not_p.prod(axis=1)\n        number_undetected = RNG.binomial(1, p_included).sum(axis=0)\n\n    # N = n + number_undetected\n    N = RNG.binomial(M, psi_samps)\n    return N\n\n# convert the dolphin capture history from '1001001' to array\ndolphin = np.loadtxt('firth.txt', dtype=str)\ndolphin = np.array([list(map(int, d)) for d in dolphin])\n\n# augment the capture history with all zero histories\nn, T = dolphin.shape\nM = 500\ndolphin_augmented = augment_history(dolphin)\n\n# covariates for t and b\noccasion_covariate = get_occasion_covariate(dolphin_augmented)\nbehavior_covariate = get_behavior_covariate(dolphin_augmented)\n\n/var/folders/7b/nb0vyhy90mdf30_65xwqzl300000gn/T/ipykernel_56378/3418041078.py:32: DeprecationWarning: `row_stack` alias is deprecated.

In practice, it would probably be better to wrap these up into a function or a class. To complete the model, I used the following priors, \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\psi &\\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 1)\\\\\n\\mu &\\sim \\text{Logistic}(0, 1) \\\\\n\\alpha_t &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma_{\\alpha}) \\\\\n\\beta &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma_{\\beta}) \\\\\n\\gamma_i &\\sim \\text{Normal}(0, \\sigma_{\\gamma}) \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\alpha} &\\sim \\text{InverseGamma}(4, 3) \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\beta} &\\sim \\text{InverseGamma}(4, 3) \\\\\n\\sigma_{\\gamma} &\\sim \\text{InverseGamma}(4, 3),\n\\end{align}\n\\] which were also used by King and Brooks (2008). Although note that I used an informative \\(\\text{Beta}(1, 5)\\) prior for \\(\\psi\\) in the full model (see below). I use the same logp seen in the occupancy and closed capture-recapture notebooks, which accounts for row-level zero-inflation. Unlike other notebooks, I did not look at the summaries or the trace plots unless the sampler indicated that it had issues during training.\nThroughout the notebook, I use the nutpie sampler within PyMC. Nutpie is a NUTS sampler written in Rust, and is often faster than PyMC. Also, I have tweaked the sampling keyword arguments for each model, since they are a little finicky.\n\ndef logp(value, n, p, psi):\n    \n    binom = binomln(n, value) + logpow(p, value) + logpow(1 - p, n - value)\n    bin_sum = pm.math.sum(binom, axis=1)\n    bin_exp = pm.math.exp(bin_sum)\n\n    res = pm.math.switch(\n        value.sum(axis=1) &gt; 0,\n        bin_exp * psi,\n        bin_exp * psi + (1 - psi)\n    )\n    \n    return pm.math.log(res)\n\n\nwith pm.Model() as m0:\n\n    #

The variance parameter, \\(\\sigma_{\\gamma},\\) seems to sample poorly. Further, models with both behavioral and individual effects lead to extremely large estimates of \\(\\psi\\). This appears to happen regardless of the size of the data augmentation \\(M.\\)\nNote that I upped the target_accept value for some models. This slows the sampler, but lowers the risk of divergence.\n\n\nModel comparison\nNext, I select a model for inference using an approximation of leave-one-out (loo) cross-validation (Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2017). This approximation can be calculated using PyMC. To do so, I calculate the log-likelihood for each model, which is added to the InferenceData object.

    "text": "In this notebook, I explore how to fit distance sampling models for estimating the size of a closed population. Similar to the occupancy and closed capture-recapture notebooks, I use parameter-expanded data-augmentation (PX-DA) and the zero-inflated binomial model in this notebook.\nThe idea with distance sampling, also known as line-transect sampling, is that a surveyer traverses a transect, typically in a boat or a plane. As they survey, they note when they detect an individual, or a group, from the species of interest, and further note the distance from the transect to the animal. Further, they note the angle to the animal(s), such that they can calculate the perpendicular distance from the animal to the transect. We assume that probability of detecting an animal \\(p\\) decreases monotonically as the distance from the transect grows, e.g., \\(p=\\exp(-x^2/\\sigma^2),\\) where \\(x\\) is the distance and \\(\\sigma\\) is a scale parameter to be estimated. These simple assumptions permit the estimation of the population size \\(N\\) as well as density \\(D.\\)\nFollowing Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 24 and Royle and Dorazio (2008), Chapter 7, I use the impala data from Burnham, Anderson, and Laake (1980), who credits P. Hemingway with the dataset. In this dataset, 73 impalas were observed along a 60km transect.

I have drawn considerable inspiration from Austin Rochford’s notebook on capture-recapture in PyMC, the second chapter of my dissertation (a work in progress), and McCrea and Morgan (2014).\n\nCormack-Jolly-Seber\nThe goal of the CJS model is to estimate survival, accounting for capture probabilities being less than one. There are many methods for estimating parameters in the model, including state-space formulations that explicitly model the latent alive/dead state \\(z.\\) Following the theme of the previous notebooks, I instead marginalize this variable out of the model by using the so-called \\(M\\)-array.

The talk will be in the Marine Science Building, Room 100, on the University of Hawaiʻi, Mānoa campus. There will be a pau hana afterwards with drinks and snacks.\nThanks to my former labmate, Dr. Brijonnay Madrigal, for putting together the following summary of the parking situation.\nZones 17 and 13 are the two locations you can park in (see map below). Zone 17 is in the structure and is a $5 flat-rate (pay at entrance kiosk) and you will just have to walk across Dole street and through lower campus to get to the Marine Sciences Building (MSB). It is about a 7-min walk from the parking structure. The other option is to park in Zone 13 in the green, visitor stalls which is closer to MSB but more expensive ($3 per 1/2 hour).\n\n\n\nVisitor parking map, with annotations by Bri\n\n\n\nRemote attendance\nTo attend remotely, click this link to follow along with the slides.

    "text": "Automated Marginalization\nPyMC has a handy experimental feature called marginalize that automatically marginalizes out discrete latent states. This means that we can sample every parameter in the model with NUTS. This is not only faster than the hybrid sampler above, it also explores the parameter space more efficiently, which can be important for complex models or challenging datasets\nmarginalize is an experimental feature, and as such should be treated with some caution.

That means that the hybrid sampler took 13 times as long! While 13 seconds doesn’t seem like a lot, remember that this is simulated data and a rather simple model. Imagine if, say, the marginal model took five minutes to fit!",

    "text": "Model \\(M_0\\)\nI explore fitting the simplest closed capture-recapture model, Model \\(M_0,\\) through parameter-expanded data-augmentation (PX-DA, Royle and Dorazio 2008). The idea with PX-DA is to augment the capture histories with \\(M-n\\) all zero capture-histories, where \\(M\\) is a hyperparameter that should be much greater than the true population size \\(N,\\) and \\(n\\) is the total number of individuals that were captured during the study. This allows us to treat the data as a zero-inflated binomial distribution (see below). In this case, we augment the history by setting \\(M=1500\\)\n\ndef augment_history(history, M):\n    '''Augment a capture history with all-zero histories.'''\n\n    animals_captured, T = history.shape\n\n    # create M - n all zero histories\n    zero_history_count = M - animals_captured\n    zero_history = np.zeros((zero_history_count, T))\n\n    # tack those on to the capture history\n    augmented = np.vstack((history, zero_history))\n\n    return augmented\n\ndef get_histories():\n    '''Read, augment, and recombine the salamander histories.'''\n\n    # read in salamander data\n    sal_data = pd.read_csv('sal_data.csv')\n\n    # labels for capture history columns\n    col_labs = [f'y{t}' for t in range(1, 5)]\n\n    # subset each dataset before augmenting\n    is_pyg = sal_data.spp == 1\n    is_red = sal_data.spp == 0\n\n    pyg = sal_data.loc[is_pyg, col_labs].to_numpy()\n    red = sal_data.loc[is_red, col_labs].to_numpy()\n\n    return {'pyg': pyg, 'red': red}\n\ndef augment_histories(histories, M):\n\n    pyg_augmented = augment_history(histories['pyg'], M=M)\n    red_augmented = augment_history(histories['red'], M=M)\n\n    # recombine into one history\n    history = np.concatenate((pyg_augmented, red_augmented))\n\n    return history\n\nhistories = get_histories()\n\nn_red, T = histories['red'].shape\nn_pyg, T = histories['pyg'].shape\n\n# # summarize into binomial data\nM = 1500\nhistory_augmented = augment_histories(histories, M=M)\nhistory_summarized = history_augmented.sum(axis=1)\n\nFor this model, I use the pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial class, just as I did in the occupancy notebook. That said, the parameters here are different. First, \\(p\\) represents the probability of capturing a given individual during the survey. Second, \\(\\psi\\) represents a mysterious entity known as the inclusion probability. That is, the probability that an individual from the hypothetical superpopulation \\(M\\) is included in the population of interest \\(N.\\) Then, we can simulate the posterior distribution for \\(N\\) using \\(M\\) and the posterior distributions of \\(\\psi.\\)\nIn this example, I combine the two species into one pm.Model object, making use of coords. That said, the parameters for each species are treated as independent. In other words, this is a “no-pooling” model.\n\n# index for each species\nspecies_idx = np.repeat([0, 1], M)\n\n# coordinates identifying parameter each species\ncoords = {'species': ['pygmy', 'red_cheeked']}\n\nwith pm.Model(coords=coords) as M0:\n\n    # priors for the capture and inclusion probabilities\n    psi = pm.Beta('psi', 0.001, 1, dims='species')\n    p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1, dims='species')\n\n    # likelihood for the summarized data\n    pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial(\n        'history',\n        p=p[species_idx],\n        psi=psi[species_idx],\n        n=T,\n        observed=history_summarized\n    )\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(M0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visual representation of model \\(M_0.\\) MarginalMixture refers to the zero-inflated binomial distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith M0:\n    M0_idata = pm.sample()\n\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [psi, p]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 6 seconds.\n\n\n\nax = az.plot_trace(M0_idata, figsize=(8,4), var_names=['psi', 'p']);\nplt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Traceplots for the salamander \\(M_0\\) model. The red-cheeked salamander is in blue while the pygmy salamander is in red.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor faster sampling, it’s better to separate the two species into two separate models. On my machine, the individual species models finish sampling in 2-3 seconds, compared to 15-20 seconds for the two species model. That said, the two species model is somewhat more convenient.\nOf course, the trace plots lack our true parameter of interest: the population size \\(N.\\) We can simulate the posterior of \\(N\\) as a derived quantity, using \\(M\\) and the posterior distribution of \\(\\psi\\).\n\n# az.extract flattens the chains\nposterior = az.extract(M0_idata)\npsi_samps = posterior.psi.values\np_samps = posterior.p.values\n\n# posterior probabilities of being present in the population but not detected\np_if_present = psi_samps * binom.pmf(0, n=T, p=p_samps)\np_total = p_if_present + (1 - psi_samps)\n\n# simulate the number of undetected animals in each population\nnumber_undetected_pyg = RNG.binomial(M - n_pyg, p_if_present[0] / p_total[0])\nnumber_undetected_red = RNG.binomial(M - n_red, p_if_present[1] / p_total[1])\n\n# simulate N\nN_pyg = n_pyg + number_undetected_pyg\nN_red = n_red + number_undetected_red\n\nBelow I plotted the posterior distributions of \\(N\\) for both species, adding the estimates from Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 24.

    "text": "NUTS sampler\nThroughout these notebooks, I have been estimating parameters with the default NUTS sampler in PyMC. One of PyMC’s great strengths is that it allows you to select different samplers with the same model code. We saw one version of this in the occupancy notebook, where we had a Binary Gibbs Sampler for the discrete \\(z_i\\) state and a NUTS sampler for the continuous parameters. But PyMC goes one step further, allowing you to choose different NUTS samplers. These include numpyro, which is itself a package for MCMC that can run on GPUs. Additionally, there is the nutpie sampler that is ultimately written in Rust. In most cases, nutpie is much faster than the default PyMC sampler. That said, nutpie can slightly less flexible.\nSince the SCR models in this notebook take a little longer to run, I will use the nutpie sampler throughout. The difference can be substantial. For instance, the unknown \\(N\\) model below takes 39 seconds with the default sampler, and 13 seconds with the nutpie sampler.\n\nwith known:\n    known_idata = pm.sample(nuts_sampler='nutpie')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sampler Progress\n    Total Chains: 4\n    Active Chains: 0\n    \n        Finished Chains:\n        4\n    \n    Sampling for now\n    \n        Estimated Time to Completion:\n        now\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Progress\n                Draws\n                Divergences\n                Step Size\n                Gradients/Draw\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.33\n                    15\n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.33\n                    15\n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.33\n                    15\n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.34\n                    15\n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\naz.summary(known_idata, var_names=['g0', 'sigma'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\ng0\n0.022\n0.003\n0.017\n0.028\n0.000\n0.000\n864.0\n1497.0\n1.0\n\n\nsigma\n94.783\n7.965\n80.985\n109.960\n0.344\n0.228\n557.0\n1103.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(\n    known_idata,\n    var_names=['g0', 'sigma'],\n    figsize=(8,4),\n    lines=[(\"g0\", {}, [g0_true]), (\"sigma\", {}, [sigma_true])]\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Trace plots for model where \\(N\\) is known.

    "text": "PyMC\nThere are many valuable tools for fitting hierarchical models in ecology, including unmarked, JAGS, NIMBLE and Stan. These are, for the most part, R libraries or programs called from R. There are relatively fewer examples of how to fit these models in Python. While most ecologists use R, they may find some benefit from using Python. For example, despite ecology being a lucrative industry, some of us might have to pivot to another field where Python may be more common. Also, Python is widely used for machine learning, which is increasingly applied in ecology.\nIn the PyMC jupyter notebooks, I try to demonstrate how to use PyMC to train the most common hierarchical models in ecology. For this, I have drawn considerable inspiration from Royle and Dorazio (2008), Kéry and Schaub (2011), McCrea and Morgan (2014), and Hooten and Hefley (2019), oftentimes simply porting their code, ideas, and analyses. In doing so, I hope to demonstrate PyMC’s core features, and highlight its strengths and weaknesses. The PyMC notebooks are somewhat sequential, with earlier notebooks explaining more basic features.",

    "text": "NumPyro\nNumPyro is another Python library for Bayesian data analysis. NumPyro runs on JAX, meaning that it utilizes your GPU for sampling. As such, NumPyro can be very fast for large datasets. PyMC conveniently allows users to sample models written in PyMC with the NumPyro backend (see this notebook for details). This is especially handy because NumPyro’s model syntax is different than PyMC, meaning that theoretically you only have to learn one syntax to reap the benefits!\nSo, why learn NumPyro at all? NumPyro has powerful tools for marginalizing discrete latent states in Hidden Markov Model (HMMs). HMMs form the theoretical background for many Bayesian population modeling frameworks, including Cormack-Jolly-Seber, Jolly-Seber, multistate, dynamic occupancy, and open-SCR. From what I can tell, PyMC lacks these features. As such, I think it is worth learning NumPyro if you are inerested in “open” models broadly. Moreover, NumPyro can fit closed models as well. Nevertheless, the NumPyro community seems less active than the PyMC community.\nAlso, I must plug the incredible biolith package in Python, which is written in NumPyro and contains many of the most common models in ecology.",

    "text": "Before I forced myself to learn it, I found the NumPyro syntax utterly beguiling. In this notebook, I hope to introduce the library in a way that I would have found helpful. Hopefully this will be helpful for you too.\nAs a motivating example, I will use the same occupancy dataset from the PyMC occupancy notebook. These data come from Henden et al. (2013), and were used as a demonstration in Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 23. They represent detection/non-detection data of Willow Warblers from Finnmark, Norway. The \\(J=27\\) sites were sampled \\(K=3\\) times. Replicating the analysis in Box 23.7 in Hooten and Hefley (2019), I use two covariates for site: site area (Pland) and willow tree height (wheight). Further, I use two covariates for visit: an indicator for the visit and willow tree height.\n\nfrom jax import random\nfrom jax.scipy.special import expit\nfrom numpyro.infer import NUTS, MCMC\nimport arviz as az\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpyro\nimport numpyro.distributions as dist\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# plotting defaults\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.rcParams['axes.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.left'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.right'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.top'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.bottom'] = False\nsns.set_palette(\"tab10\")\n\n# hyperparameters\nM = 1500\nTUNING_DRAWS = 1000\nDRAWS = 1000\nCHAINS = 1\nRANDOM_SEED = 17\n\ndef scale(x):\n    '''Scale x: 0 is the mean and 1 is one standard deviation from the mean.'''\n    return (x - np.nanmean(x)) / np.nanstd(x)\n\ndef get_warbler_data():\n\n    # read in the data\n    data = pd.read_csv('PlosOne-DataFinnmark.csv')\n\n    # subset the data to select willow warbler\n    is_warbler = data.Species == \"Willow Warbler\"\n    Y = data.loc[is_warbler, ['Y05.1', 'Y05.2', 'Y05.3']].to_numpy()\n    n, J = Y.shape\n\n    # generate site covariate matrix\n    site_intercept = np.ones(n)\n    pland = scale(data.loc[is_warbler, 'Pland']).to_numpy()\n    wheight = scale(data.loc[is_warbler, 'wheight']).to_numpy()\n\n    X = np.c_[site_intercept, pland, wheight]\n\n    # generate visit covariate array\n    visit_int = np.ones_like(Y)\n    visit_wheight = np.repeat(wheight, repeats=J).reshape(n, J)\n\n    # indicates which visit this is [0, 1, 2, 0, ...]\n    _, visit_indicator = np.indices(Y.shape)\n    visit_indicator = scale(visit_indicator)\n\n    W = np.stack((visit_int, visit_indicator, visit_wheight), axis=2)\n\n    return {\n        'detection_data': Y,\n        'site_covariates': X,\n        'visit_covariates': W\n    }\n\nOur observations are a matrix of of binary detection data, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\), where the \\(y_{i,j}=1\\) if a warbler was detected at site \\(i\\) during survey \\(j\\), and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) has shape \\((J, K)\\). We encode our site level covariates as a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X},\\) with shape \\((J, 3),\\) where each row contains an intercept, pland and wheight. We model the effects of these covariates on the probability that each site is occupied with \\(z_{i} \\sim \\text{Bern}(\\psi)\\) where \\(\\psi = \\mathbf{X}\\beta.\\) We assume that warblers can only be detected at occupied sites with probability \\(p_{ij}\\). As such, we model each observation as \\(y_{i,j} \\sim \\text{Bern}(z_i p_{i,j})\\). We encode visit-level covariates was an array \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) with shape \\((J, K, 3)\\), where the last dimension contains an intercept, a visit indicator, and the wheight. We model the effect of these covariates on the probability of detection with \\(\\mathbf{P}=\\mathbf{W}\\alpha.\\)\n\nDefining the model\nWe define our NumPyro model as a Python function. Let’s look at one of these functions: an occupancy model with site and visit covariates.\n\ndef occupancy_model(data_dictionary):\n\n    detection_data = data_dictionary['detection_data']\n    site_count, visit_count = detection_data.shape\n\n    # site-level linear model\n    # three beta effects in linear model, each getting its own Normal(0, 2) prior\n    with numpyro.plate('site-effects', 3):\n        beta = numpyro.sample('Beta', dist.Normal(0, 2))\n\n    # we will always use jax.numpy (jnp) for numpy like operations\n    site_covs = data_dictionary['site_covariates']\n    logit_psi = jnp.dot(site_covs, beta)\n\n    # jax.scipy contains scipy like operations, like jax.scipy.special.expit()\n    psi = numpyro.deterministic('psi', expit(logit_psi))\n\n    # visit level linear model\n    # three alpha effects in linear model, each getting its own Normal(0, 2) prior\n    with numpyro.plate('visit-effects', 3):\n        alpha = numpyro.sample('Alpha', dist.Normal(0, 2))\n\n    # linear model for the detection probability\n    visit_covs = data_dictionary['visit_covariates']\n    logit_p = jnp.dot(visit_covs, alpha)\n    p = numpyro.deterministic('p', expit(logit_p))\n\n    # here we let numpyro know that there will be site_count binary z states\n    with numpyro.plate('sites', site_count):\n\n        # the vector of z states will be bernoulli distributed with parameter psi\n        z = numpyro.sample(\n            'z',\n            dist.Bernoulli(psi),\n            infer={'enumerate': 'parallel'} # this is where we marginalize!\n        )\n\n        # NumPyro is finnicky with shapes, especially with enumeration\n        # this helps ensure that the site dimensions are facing each other\n        mu_y = z * p.T\n\n        # encode the likelihood by adding obs (transposed to match above)\n        with numpyro.plate('visits', visit_count):\n            numpyro.sample(\"y\", dist.Bernoulli(mu_y), obs=detection_data.T)\n\nYou might notice that the function lacks a return statement, which can look a bit odd. That’s because NumPyro registers random variables in the function to a handler, such as an MCMC sampler. This gives the language and syntax flexibility to exchange handlers and models.\nThere are two NumPyro functions that are called repeatedly in the occupancy_model function: numpyro.sample and numpyro.plate. The numpyro.plate function can be thought of as a vectorized loop over conditionally independent dimensions. For example, each one of our site-effects, that is, the \\(\\beta\\) values in the linear model for \\(\\psi\\), is independent conditional on the hyperparameters \\(\\mu=0\\) and \\(\\sigma=2\\). In JAGS, we might write this code as:\nfor (i in 1:3){\n    beta[i] ~ dnorm(0, 0.5)\n}\nIn NumPyro, we can write this as,\n\nwith numpyro.plate('site-effects', 3):\n    beta = numpyro.sample('beta', dist.Normal(0, 2))\n\nwhich creates a vector of beta effects for our linear model.\nThe numpyro.sample sample function is how we define random variables. The first argument is the name, i.e., how we’ll access the variable later. The second argument is the actual distribution we’re assigning to the random variable. These distribution functions reside in NumPyro’s distributions module. This syntax should be familiar with PyMC users. In PyMC, the above statement would be beta = pm.Normal('beta', 0, 2, dims='site-effects').\nThe obs argument in numpyro.sample defines whether each random variable is observed. In the occupancy model, the unobserved random variables include the priors for the coefficients in the linear model, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\), as well as the discrete latent variable \\(\\mathbf{z}\\). Recall that \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) is a vector of length site_count because it within the plate for sites. The one observed random variable is \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\). As such, the distribution for \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) encodes the likelihood. Since \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is two dimensional, we include another plate for the visits.\n\n\nAutomated marginalization\nThe distribution for the latent occupancy state, \\(\\mathbf{z},\\) looks slightly different than the others because it includes the additional argument, infer={'enumerate': 'parallel'}. This tells NumPyro to marginalize this discrete latent variable. To do so, NumPyro enumerates the possible outcomes for this variable. At sites where the species was never detected, the possible outcomes are that the species is not truly present, or that it is truly present and just never detected. As such, the model enumerates these outcomes as:\n\\[\nP(\\mathbf{y}_j)=\n\\begin{cases}\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j \\; + \\; (1 - \\psi_j),   & \\text{if } \\mathbf{y}_j = \\mathbf{0}\\\\\n    P(\\mathbf{y}_j | z_j = 1)\\; \\psi_j,  & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\nInference\nInference is fairly straightforward in NumPyro, although more verbose than PyMC. First, we define which sampler we would like to use on our model. We input this kernel into the MCMC initializer, specifying the configuration (chains, draws, tune, etc.). Finally, we run the MCMC algorithm.\n\nwarbler_data = get_warbler_data()\nrng_key = random.PRNGKey(RANDOM_SEED)\n\n# specify which sampler you want to use\nnuts_kernel = NUTS(occupancy_model)\n\n# configure the MCMC run\nmcmc = MCMC(nuts_kernel, num_warmup=500, num_samples=1000, num_chains=4)\n\n# run the MCMC then inspect the output\nmcmc.run(rng_key, warbler_data)\nmcmc.print_summary()\n\n/var/folders/7b/nb0vyhy90mdf30_65xwqzl300000gn/T/ipykernel_79767/1360101409.py:8: UserWarning: There are not enough devices to run parallel chains: expected 4 but got 1.

We learned that numpyro.plate can generate a vector (or an array) of random varaibles, making it easy to vectorize operations within our model. We learned that we generate the random variables themselves with numpyro.sample, which requires us to specify a distribution from the numpyro.distributions module. Finally, we learned that we can marginalize out discrete latent states with the infer={'enumerate': 'parallel'} argument to numpyro.sample. In the following notebooks, we will introduce how we can marginalize out discrete latent states in Hidden Markov Models.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHenden, John-André, Nigel G Yoccoz, Rolf A Ims, and Knut Langeland. 2013. “How Spatial Variation in Areal Extent and Configuration of Labile Vegetation States Affect the Riparian Bird Community in Arctic Tundra.” PLoS One 8 (5): e63312.\n\n\nHooten, Mevin B, and Trevor Hefley. 2019.

    "text": "I started exploring NumPyro because of its ability to marginalize discrete latent states in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Thankfully, the NumPyro website includes a handy tutorial on how to fit a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model in NumPyro. Unfortunately, this tutorial also assumes familiarity with many NumPyro concepts. As such, it took me some time to grasp everything that was going on within it. This notebook will hopefully be a gentler introduction to ecological HMMs in NumPyro.\nIn this notebook, I will demonstrate how to estimate patch colonization and extinction with dynamic occupancy models in NumPyro. In a dynamic occupancy model, occupied patches can go extinct (\\(\\epsilon\\)) or remain occupied (\\(1-\\epsilon\\)). Additionally, unoccupied patches can be colonized (\\(\\gamma\\)) or remain unoccupied (\\(1-\\gamma\\)) (Figure 1). The proportion of patches occupied at the first time step is dictated by the parameter \\(\\psi\\), i.e., the initial occupancy probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noccupancy\n\n\n\nU1\n\nz₁ = 0\nUnoccupied\n\n\n\nU2\n\nz₂ = 0\nUnoccupied\n\n\n\nU1-&gt;U2\n\n\n1-γ\n\n\n\nO2\n\nz₂ = 1\nOccupied\n\n\n\nU1-&gt;O2\n\n\nγ\n\n\n\nO1\n\nz₁ = 1\nOccupied\n\n\n\nO1-&gt;U2\n\n\nε\n\n\n\nO1-&gt;O2\n\n\n1-ε\n\n\n\nStart\n\nInitial\n\n\n\nStart-&gt;U1\n\n\n1-ψ\n\n\n\nStart-&gt;O1\n\n\nψ\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Dynamic occupancy model with latent state variable z\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom jax import random\nfrom numpyro.contrib.control_flow import scan\nfrom numpyro.infer import NUTS, MCMC, Predictive\nimport arviz as az\nimport jax.numpy as jnp\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport numpyro\nimport numpyro.distributions as dist\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# plotting defaults\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.rcParams['axes.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.left'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.right'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.top'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.bottom'] = False\nsns.set_palette(\"tab10\")\n\n# hyperparameters\nRANDOM_SEED = 1792\n\n## true values for colext model\nPSI_TRUE = 0.6\nEPSILON_TRUE = 0.3\nGAMMA_TRUE = 0.15\nP_TRUE = 0.4\nSITE_COUNT = 250\nSURVEY_COUNT = 3\nSEASON_COUNT = 10\n\ndef simulate_data():\n    \"\"\"Simulate detection/non-detection data from a dynamic occupancy model\"\"\"\n\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(RANDOM_SEED)\n\n    # empty array to fill in the occupancy states later\n    z = np.zeros((SITE_COUNT, SEASON_COUNT), dtype=int)\n\n    # initial values for the occupancy state\n    z[:, 0] = rng.binomial(n=1, p=PSI_TRUE, size=SITE_COUNT)\n\n    # simulate transitions\n    for t in range(1, SEASON_COUNT):\n\n        # patches can be colonized, go extinct, remain occupied, or remain unoccupied\n        mu_z = z[:, t-1] * (1 - EPSILON_TRUE) + (1 - z[:, t-1]) * GAMMA_TRUE\n        z[:, t] = rng.binomial(n=1, p=mu_z)\n\n    # simulate detection non-detection data\n    mu_x = z * P_TRUE\n    x = rng.binomial(n=1, p=mu_x[:, :, None],\n                    size=(SITE_COUNT, SEASON_COUNT, SURVEY_COUNT))\n    return x\n\nAs with the static occupancy model, we can parameterize the model in terms of its latent \\(z_{i,j}\\) state, which indicates if site \\(i\\) was occupied. The primary difference is that \\(\\mathbf{Z}\\) is now a matrix, where \\(j\\) indicates the “season”, or primary period. States can transition between seasons. States are however, constant between surveys, or secondary periods, which take place within a season. As such, \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) is now an array, with shape (site_count, season_count, survey_count), where \\(y_{i,j,k} \\sim \\text{Bern}(z_{i,j} \\, p)\\). It’s possible to include covariate effects on any of the four probabilities in the model: \\(\\psi, \\gamma, \\epsilon\\), and \\(p.\\) Nevertheless, we will introduce the NumPyro syntax with a simple model where every parameter is constant across sites, seasons, and visits.\n\nDefining the model\nJust like in the introductory notebook to NumPyro, we will define our dynamic occupancy model with a Python function, dynamic_occupancy(), that contains NumPyro random variables. This model, however, will contain a new character, the scan() function, as well as an additional function within our model transition_and_detect(). The scan() function sequentially applies the transition_and_detect() to our occupancy data, starting with initial values.\n\ndef dynamic_occupancy(detection_history):\n    '''Dynamic occupancy model in NumPyro.'''\n    site_count, season_count, survey_count = detection_history.shape\n\n    # scalar priors for the four probabilistic parameters\n    psi = numpyro.sample(\"psi\", dist.Uniform(0, 1))  # initial occupancy prob\n    gamma = numpyro.sample(\"gamma\", dist.Uniform(0, 1)) # colonization prob\n    epsilon = numpyro.sample(\"epsilon\", dist.Uniform(0, 1)) # extinction prob\n    p = numpyro.sample(\"p\", dist.Uniform(0, 1))  # recapture prob\n\n    def transition_and_detect(carry, y_t):\n        \"\"\"Transitions betweens states and defines the likelihood.\"\"\"\n\n        # unpack the values that are returned from the transition function at\n        # the previous time step\n        z_prev, t = carry\n\n        # transition the latent state at every site\n        with numpyro.plate(\"sites\", site_count):\n\n            # probability of transitioning according to the previous state\n            mu_z_t = z_prev * (1 - epsilon) + (1 - z_prev) * gamma\n\n            # dist.util.clamp_probs() helps the sampler avoid boundary regions\n            z = numpyro.sample(\n                \"z\",\n                dist.Bernoulli(dist.util.clamp_probs(mu_z_t)),\n                infer={\"enumerate\": \"parallel\"}, # this is where we marginalize!\n            )\n\n            # the likelihood of each observation at each site\n            mu_y = z * p\n            with numpyro.plate('surveys', survey_count):\n                numpyro.sample(\n                    \"y\",\n                    dist.Bernoulli(dist.util.clamp_probs(mu_y)),\n                    obs=y_t.T\n                )\n\n            # carry forward the current z state and incremented time index\n            # None indicates we don't return/accumulate any outputs from scan\n            return (z, t + 1), None\n\n    # the initial state only depends on psi\n    with numpyro.plate('sites', site_count):\n        z0 = numpyro.sample(\n            \"z0\",\n            dist.Bernoulli(dist.util.clamp_probs(psi)),\n            infer={\"enumerate\": \"parallel\"},\n        )\n\n        # compute the likelihood of the detection data for just the first season\n        mu_y = z0 * p\n        with numpyro.plate('surveys', survey_count):\n            numpyro.sample(\n                \"y0\",\n                dist.Bernoulli(dist.util.clamp_probs(mu_y)),\n                obs=detection_history[:, 0].T # just the first occasion!\n            )\n\n    # now we scan (or apply) the transition function across the remaining seasons\n    scan(\n        transition_and_detect,                        # function to scan\n        (z0, 0),                                      # initial states\n        jnp.swapaxes(detection_history[:, 1:], 0, 1), # scan across first dimension of data\n    )\n\nAs the name suggests, transition_and_detect() transitions the discrete latent states (the process model) and detects animals during the surveys (the observation model). As such, it contains our unobserved random variable z as well as our observed random variable y. scan() requires that our inner function, transition_and_detect(), return a tuple, where the first element contains the input to the next iteration of transition_and_detect(). The next element is anything we want to report or accumulate (in this case, None, since we don’t need to track anything).\nFor the most part, the transition_and_detect() function is not much different than our model in the NumPyro static occupancy notebook. One difference is the use of dist.util.clamp_probs(). This is a helper function that keeps the sampler out of boundary regions, for example, by keeping \\(\\psi\\) between \\([1 \\times 10^{-7}, 1 - 1 \\times 10^{-7}]\\) rather than \\([0, 1]\\).\nWe begin the scan after the first occasion. The \\(z_{i,j}\\) state at the first occasion only depends on \\(\\psi\\). After this first occasion, we transition the states such that patches can be colonized or go extinct.\n\ndetections = simulate_data()\nrng_key = random.PRNGKey(RANDOM_SEED)\n\n# specify which sampler you want to use\nnuts_kernel = NUTS(dynamic_occupancy)\n\n# configure the MCMC run\nmcmc = MCMC(nuts_kernel, num_warmup=500, num_samples=1000, num_chains=4)\n\n# run the MCMC then inspect the output\nmcmc.run(rng_key, detections)\nmcmc.print_summary()\n\n/var/folders/7b/nb0vyhy90mdf30_65xwqzl300000gn/T/ipykernel_31434/1038765192.py:8: UserWarning: There are not enough devices to run parallel chains: expected 4 but got 1.

    "text": "Jolly-Seber models are a form of open-population capture-recapture models that estimate survival and abundance. They do so by estimating recruitment, broadly defined, at every time step. Contrast this with Cormack-Jolly-Seber models, which ignore recruitment to focus on just estimating survival.\nThere are many parameterizations of the Jolly-Seber model. For example, the Jolly-Seber model can be conceived of as a multi-state model with three states: not yet entered, alive, and dead (Kéry and Schaub 2011) (Figure 1). Those who have not yet entered, \\(z_{i,t}=0\\), can be recruited into the population, e.g., be born or immigrate into it, thus having \\(z_{i, t+1}=1\\). These individuals may be captured with probability \\(p\\). Then, these individuals might die or immigrate out of the population, thus having \\(z_{i, t+1}=2\\). Such individuals can never re-enter the population.\nThis multi-state version of the Jolly-Seber is essentially the same as the restricted occupancy parameterization (Royle and Dorazio 2008, chap. 10). As such, the \\(\\gamma\\) parameter is a nuisance parameter with no biological meaning (Kéry and Schaub 2011) (Figure 1). It represents “removal entry probabilities” (Kéry and Schaub 2011), i.e., the probability that the individual is removed from the superpopulation at time \\(t\\), which contains \\(M\\) individuals. As such, \\(\\gamma\\) tends to grow over time because \\(M\\) is fixed across all periods.

In some ways, this model is actually much simpler because we do not have to worry about recruitment into the population. This model does, however, introduce a new character from the NumPyro-verse: handlers.mask().\nhandlers.mask() tells NumPyro: do not include this the sample of z in the log probability computation when the mask is False. In this case, the mask, has_been_captured, indicates whether the animal has been captured by time t. As such, we essentially ignore the z state until the animal is captured. We include the mask in the carry, and update it with new data after we transition the z state (i.e., after the animal has survived or died between intervals).\nThe model requires one more trick to run. Essentially, we need to ensure that z[t]=1 during the occasion of the animal’s first capture. To do so, we employ the mask: mu_z_t = has_been_captured * phi * z + (1 - has_been_captured). This forces z[t]=1 until the animals first capture. After the animal’s first capture, the z state is included in the log probability calculation, and mu_z_t simplifies to phi * z.\n\ndef p_dot_phi_dot(capture_history):\n\n    capture_count, _ = capture_history.shape\n    phi = numpyro.sample(\"phi\", dist.Uniform(0.0, 1.0))\n    p = numpyro.sample(\"p\", dist.Uniform(0.0, 1.0))\n\n    def transition_fn(carry, y):\n\n        has_been_captured, z = carry\n\n        with numpyro.plate(\"animals\", capture_count, dim=-1):\n\n            # only compute log probs for animals where has_been_captured is True\n            with handlers.mask(mask=has_been_captured):\n\n                # force mu_z_t=1 during the occasion of the animal's first capture\n                mu_z_t = has_been_captured * phi * z + (1 - has_been_captured)\n                z = numpyro.sample(\n                    \"z\",\n                    dist.Bernoulli(dist.util.clamp_probs(mu_z_t)),\n                    infer={\"enumerate\": \"parallel\"},\n                )\n\n                mu_y_t = p * z\n                numpyro.sample(\n                    \"y\", dist.Bernoulli(dist.util.clamp_probs(mu_y_t)), obs=y\n                )\n\n        has_been_captured = has_been_captured | y.astype(bool)\n        return (has_been_captured, z), None\n\n    z = jnp.ones(capture_count, dtype=jnp.int32)\n    has_been_captured = capture_history[:, 0].astype(bool)\n    scan(\n        transition_fn,\n        (has_been_captured, z),\n        jnp.swapaxes(capture_history[:, 1:], 0, 1),\n    )\n\n\n# data\ndipper = np.loadtxt('dipper.csv', delimiter=',', dtype=np.int32)\n\nrng_key = random.PRNGKey(RANDOM_SEED)\n\n# specify which sampler you want to use\nnuts_kernel = NUTS(p_dot_phi_dot) # 11 seconds\n\n# configure the MCMC run\nmcmc = MCMC(nuts_kernel, num_warmup=WARMUP_COUNT, num_samples=SAMPLE_COUNT,\n            num_chains=CHAIN_COUNT)\n\n# run the MCMC then inspect the output\nmcmc.run(rng_key, dipper)\nmcmc.print_summary()\n\n/var/folders/7b/nb0vyhy90mdf30_65xwqzl300000gn/T/ipykernel_40148/284679213.py:10: UserWarning: There are not enough devices to run parallel chains: expected 4 but got 1.

    "text": "In this notebook, I explore fitting closed population capture-recapture models in PyMC. Capture-recapture, at least the Lincoln-Peterson estimator, has been around for almost 100 years. Since then, countless varieties of capture-recapture models have been developed for closed populations (Otis et al. 1978).\nThe basic steps in capture-recapture are: capture several individuals–e.g., via trapping–from the population of interest, mark these animals, then release them. We repeat this process several times, each time noting when we recapture individuals.\nThis produces a capture history for each individual, which allows us to estimate the probability of capture and the number of individuals in the population \\(N\\).",

    "text": "Model \\(M_0\\)\nI explore fitting the simplest closed capture-recapture model, Model \\(M_0,\\) through parameter-expanded data-augmentation (PX-DA, Royle and Dorazio 2008). The idea with PX-DA is to augment the capture histories with \\(M-n\\) all zero capture-histories, where \\(M\\) is a hyperparameter that should be much greater than the true population size \\(N,\\) and \\(n\\) is the total number of individuals that were captured during the study. This allows us to treat the data as a zero-inflated binomial distribution (see below). In this case, we augment the history by setting \\(M=1500\\)\n\ndef augment_history(history, M):\n    '''Augment a capture history with all-zero histories.'''\n\n    animals_captured, T = history.shape\n\n    # create M - n all zero histories\n    zero_history_count = M - animals_captured\n    zero_history = np.zeros((zero_history_count, T))\n\n    # tack those on to the capture history\n    augmented = np.vstack((history, zero_history))\n\n    return augmented\n\ndef get_histories():\n    '''Read, augment, and recombine the salamander histories.'''\n\n    # read in salamander data\n    sal_data = pd.read_csv('sal_data.csv')\n\n    # labels for capture history columns\n    col_labs = [f'y{t}' for t in range(1, 5)]\n\n    # subset each dataset before augmenting\n    is_pyg = sal_data.spp == 1\n    is_red = sal_data.spp == 0\n\n    pyg = sal_data.loc[is_pyg, col_labs].to_numpy()\n    red = sal_data.loc[is_red, col_labs].to_numpy()\n\n    return {'pyg': pyg, 'red': red}\n\ndef augment_histories(histories, M):\n\n    pyg_augmented = augment_history(histories['pyg'], M=M)\n    red_augmented = augment_history(histories['red'], M=M)\n\n    # recombine into one history\n    history = np.concatenate((pyg_augmented, red_augmented))\n\n    return history\n\nhistories = get_histories()\n\nn_red, T = histories['red'].shape\nn_pyg, T = histories['pyg'].shape\n\n# # summarize into binomial data\nM = 1500\nhistory_augmented = augment_histories(histories, M=M)\nhistory_summarized = history_augmented.sum(axis=1)\n\nFor this model, I use the pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial class, just as I did in the occupancy notebook. That said, the parameters here are different. First, \\(p\\) represents the probability of capturing a given individual during the survey. Second, \\(\\psi\\) represents a mysterious entity known as the inclusion probability. That is, the probability that an individual from the hypothetical superpopulation \\(M\\) is included in the population of interest \\(N.\\) Then, we can simulate the posterior distribution for \\(N\\) using \\(M\\) and the posterior distributions of \\(\\psi.\\)\nIn this example, I combine the two species into one pm.Model object, making use of coords. That said, the parameters for each species are treated as independent. In other words, this is a “no-pooling” model.\n\n# index for each species\nspecies_idx = np.repeat([0, 1], M)\n\n# coordinates identifying parameter each species\ncoords = {'species': ['pygmy', 'red_cheeked']}\n\nwith pm.Model(coords=coords) as M0:\n\n    # priors for the capture and inclusion probabilities\n    psi = pm.Beta('psi', 0.001, 1, dims='species')\n    p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1, dims='species')\n\n    # likelihood for the summarized data\n    pm.ZeroInflatedBinomial(\n        'history',\n        p=p[species_idx],\n        psi=psi[species_idx],\n        n=T,\n        observed=history_summarized\n    )\n\npm.model_to_graphviz(M0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Visual representation of model \\(M_0.\\) MarginalMixture refers to the zero-inflated binomial distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwith M0:\n    M0_idata = pm.sample()\n\nInitializing NUTS using jitter+adapt_diag...\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nNUTS: [psi, p]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 6 seconds.\n\n\n\nax = az.plot_trace(M0_idata, figsize=(8,4), var_names=['psi', 'p']);\nplt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Traceplots for the salamander \\(M_0\\) model. The red-cheeked salamander is in blue while the pygmy salamander is in red.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor faster sampling, it’s better to separate the two species into two separate models. On my machine, the individual species models finish sampling in 2-3 seconds, compared to 15-20 seconds for the two species model. That said, the two species model is somewhat more convenient.\nOf course, the trace plots lack our true parameter of interest: the population size \\(N.\\) We can simulate the posterior of \\(N\\) as a derived quantity, using \\(M\\) and the posterior distribution of \\(\\psi\\).\n\n# az.extract flattens the chains\nposterior = az.extract(M0_idata)\npsi_samps = posterior.psi.values\np_samps = posterior.p.values\n\n# posterior probabilities of being present in the population but not detected\np_if_present = psi_samps * binom.pmf(0, n=T, p=p_samps)\np_total = p_if_present + (1 - psi_samps)\n\n# simulate the number of undetected animals in each population\nnumber_undetected_pyg = RNG.binomial(M - n_pyg, p_if_present[0] / p_total[0])\nnumber_undetected_red = RNG.binomial(M - n_red, p_if_present[1] / p_total[1])\n\n# simulate N\nN_pyg = n_pyg + number_undetected_pyg\nN_red = n_red + number_undetected_red\n\nBelow I plotted the posterior distributions of \\(N\\) for both species, adding the estimates from Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 24.

There are many methods for estimating parameters in the model, including state-space formulations that explicitly model the latent alive/dead state \\(z.\\) Following the theme of the previous notebooks, I instead marginalize this variable out of the model by using the so-called \\(M\\)-array.

The benefit of these models is that, by treating each species as a random effect, they can estimate occupancy and detection more precisely than single species models. Further, through data augmentation, they can estimate the richness of the supercommunity, that is, the total number of species that use the study area during the surveys.",

    "text": "Unknown \\(N\\)\nNext, I train the unknown \\(N\\) version of the model. Like many other notebooks in this series, it relies on augmenting the detection histories with all-zero histories. These represent the detection histories for species that may use the study site, but were not detected over the \\(K=11\\) surveys. I also augment the species names in the coords dict, such that we can still use the dims argument in the multivariate normal. Mirroring Royle and Dorazio (2008), I augment the history \\(M - n\\) all-zero histories, where \\(M=250\\) and \\(n\\) is the number of species detected during the survey.\n\nThe CustomDist class\nIn the notebooks for closed models, we have relied on the marginalize function from pymc_extras. In my testing, however, this function fails with this model, perhaps because of the the double layers of zero inflation (site occupation, community inclusion). As such, we will have to marginalize the discrete latent state for inclusion, \\(w,\\) ourselves. To do so, we have to create a custom distribution via PyMC’s CustomDist class.\nCustomDist requires two main inputs: logp and random. The logp is the log probability statement, which is similar to how one might define the likelihood in Stan. In this case, the logp is exactly how we would marginalize the discrete latent \\(w\\) state. In this case, we do so on the log scale with functions like log1m_exp, which adds numerical stability. The downside is that it can be a little harder to understand on this scale. In this case, I essentially provided a placeholder for the random argument, since I only ever use it for observed random variables (i.e., we never have to sample this variable).

    "text": "In this notebook, I show how to train spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models in PyMC. SCR expands upon traditional capture-recapture by incorporating the location of the traps in the analysis. This matters because, typically, animals that live near a particular trap are more likely to be caught in it. In doing so, SCR links individual-level processes to the population-level, expanding the scientific scope of simple designs.\nIn this notebook, I train the simplest possible SCR model, SCR0 (Royle et al. 2013, chap. 5), where the goal is estimating the true population size \\(N\\). Similar to the other closed population notebooks, I do so using parameter-expanded data-augmentation (PX-DA). I also borrow the concept of the detection function from the distance sampling notebook.\nAs a motivating example, I use the ovenbird mist netting dataset provided by Murray Efford via the secr package in R. The design of the study is outlined in Efford, Dawson, and Robbins (2004) and Borchers and Efford (2008). In this dataset, ovenbirds were trapped in 44 mist nets over 8 to 10 consecutive days during the summers of 2005 to 2009.\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'\n\nimport arviz as az\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pymc as pm\nimport pymc_extras as pmx\nimport pytensor.tensor as pt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# only necessary on MacOS Sequoia\n# https://discourse.pymc.io/t/pytensor-fails-to-compile-model-after-upgrading-to-mac-os-15-4/16796/5\nimport pytensor\npytensor.config.cxx = '/usr/bin/clang++'\n\n# hyper parameters\nSEED = 42\nRNG = np.random.default_rng(SEED)\nBUFFER = 100\nM = 200\n\n# plotting defaults\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.rcParams['axes.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = 'white'\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.left'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.right'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.top'] = False\nplt.rcParams['axes.spines.bottom'] = False\nsns.set_palette(\"tab10\")\n\ndef invlogit(x):\n    '''Inverse logit function'''\n    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))\n\ndef euclid_dist(X, S, library='np'):\n    '''Pairwise euclidian distance between points in (M, 2) and (N, 2) arrays'''\n    diff = X[np.newaxis, :, :] - S[:, np.newaxis, :]\n\n    if library == 'np':\n        return np.sqrt(np.sum(diff ** 2, axis=-1))\n\n    elif library == 'pm':\n        return pm.math.sqrt(pm.math.sum(diff ** 2, axis=-1))\n\ndef half_normal(d, s, library='np'):\n    '''Half normal detection function.'''\n    if library == 'np':\n        return np.exp( - (d ** 2) / (2 * s ** 2))\n\n    elif library == 'pm':\n        return pm.math.exp( - (d ** 2) / (2 * s ** 2))\n\ndef exponential(d, s, library='np'):\n    '''Negative exponential detection function.'''\n    if library == 'np':\n        return np.exp(- d / s)\n\n    elif library == 'pm':\n        return pm.math.exp(- d / s)\n\n# coordinates for each trap\novenbird_trap = pd.read_csv('ovenbirdtrap.txt', delimiter=' ')\ntrap_count, _ = ovenbird_trap.shape\n\n# information about each trap\ntrap_x = ovenbird_trap.x\ntrap_y = ovenbird_trap.y\nX = ovenbird_trap[['x', 'y']].to_numpy()\n\n# define the state space around the traps\nx_max = trap_x.max() + BUFFER\ny_max = trap_y.max() + BUFFER\nx_min = trap_x.min() - BUFFER\ny_min = trap_y.min() - BUFFER\n\n# scale for plotting\nscale = (y_max - y_min) / (x_max - x_min)\n\n# plot the trap locations\nplot_width = 2\nplot_height = plot_width * scale\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(plot_width, plot_height))\n\n# plot the traps\nax.scatter(trap_x, trap_y, marker='x', s=40, linewidth=1.5, color='C1')\nax.set_ylim((y_min, y_max))\nax.set_xlim((x_min, x_max))\n\nax.annotate(\n    '44 nets\\n30m apart', ha='center',\n    xy=(55, -150), xycoords='data', color='black',\n    xytext=(40, 30), textcoords='offset points',\n    arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=\"-&gt;\", color='black', linewidth=1,\n                    connectionstyle=\"angle3,angleA=90,angleB=0\"))\n\n# aesthetics\nax.set_aspect('equal')\nax.set_title('Mist net locations')\nax.grid(False)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Locations of the mist nets in the ovenbird dataset (Efford, Dawson, and Robbins 2004)\nOne difference between spatial and traditional (non-spatial) capture is the addition of the trap identifier in the capture history.

    "text": "NUTS sampler\nThroughout these notebooks, I have been estimating parameters with the default NUTS sampler in PyMC. One of PyMC’s great strengths is that it allows you to select different samplers with the same model code. We saw one version of this in the occupancy notebook, where we had a Binary Gibbs Sampler for the discrete \\(z_i\\) state and a NUTS sampler for the continuous parameters. But PyMC goes one step further, allowing you to choose different NUTS samplers. These include numpyro, which is itself a package for MCMC that can run on GPUs. Additionally, there is the nutpie sampler that is ultimately written in Rust. In most cases, nutpie is much faster than the default PyMC sampler. That said, nutpie can slightly less flexible.\nSince the SCR models in this notebook take a little longer to run, I will use the nutpie sampler throughout. The difference can be substantial. For instance, the unknown \\(N\\) model below takes 39 seconds with the default sampler, and 13 seconds with the nutpie sampler.\n\nwith known:\n    known_idata = pm.sample(nuts_sampler='nutpie')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Sampler Progress\n    Total Chains: 4\n    Active Chains: 0\n    \n        Finished Chains:\n        4\n    \n    Sampling for now\n    \n        Estimated Time to Completion:\n        now\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Progress\n                Draws\n                Divergences\n                Step Size\n                Gradients/Draw\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.33\n                    15\n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.33\n                    15\n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.33\n                    15\n                \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \n                    \n                    2000\n                    0\n                    0.34\n                    15\n                \n            \n            \n        \n    \n\n\n\n\naz.summary(known_idata, var_names=['g0', 'sigma'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\ng0\n0.022\n0.003\n0.017\n0.028\n0.000\n0.000\n864.0\n1497.0\n1.0\n\n\nsigma\n94.783\n7.965\n80.985\n109.960\n0.344\n0.228\n557.0\n1103.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naz.plot_trace(\n    known_idata,\n    var_names=['g0', 'sigma'],\n    figsize=(8,4),\n    lines=[(\"g0\", {}, [g0_true]), (\"sigma\", {}, [sigma_true])]\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Trace plots for model where \\(N\\) is known.

    "text": "In this notebook, I explore how to fit distance sampling models for estimating the size of a closed population. Similar to the occupancy and closed capture-recapture notebooks, I use parameter-expanded data-augmentation (PX-DA) and the zero-inflated binomial model in this notebook.\nThe idea with distance sampling, also known as line-transect sampling, is that a surveyer traverses a transect, typically in a boat or a plane. As they survey, they note when they detect an individual, or a group, from the species of interest, and further note the distance from the transect to the animal. Further, they note the angle to the animal(s), such that they can calculate the perpendicular distance from the animal to the transect. We assume that probability of detecting an animal \\(p\\) decreases monotonically as the distance from the transect grows, e.g., \\(p=\\exp(-x^2/\\sigma^2),\\) where \\(x\\) is the distance and \\(\\sigma\\) is a scale parameter to be estimated. These simple assumptions permit the estimation of the population size \\(N\\) as well as density \\(D.\\)\nFollowing Hooten and Hefley (2019), Chapter 24 and Royle and Dorazio (2008), Chapter 7, I use the impala data from Burnham, Anderson, and Laake (1980), who credits P. Hemingway with the dataset. In this dataset, 73 impalas were observed along a 60km transect.

The PyMC equivalent is p = pm.Uniform('p', 0, 1). This could, alternatively, be specified as p = pm.Uniform('detection probability', 0, 1).

This is a trick that’s related to NumPy’s broadcasting rules. Broadcasting allows us to multiply arrays with different dimensions. In this case, we have a vector z that we would like to multiply against a matrix p, such that the first value in z is multiplied against every value in the first row of p, and so on. R does this naturally since it has slightly different broadcasting rules than NumPy. To do this in NumPy, we need to make z a column vector by adding a dummy dimension, hence the [:, None].\n\nwith binary_gibbs:\n    binary_gibbs_idata = pm.sample()\naz.summary(binary_gibbs_idata, var_names=['beta0', 'beta1', 'alpha0', 'alpha1'])\n\nMultiprocess sampling (4 chains in 4 jobs)\nCompoundStep\n&gt;NUTS: [beta0, beta1, alpha0, alpha1]\n&gt;BinaryGibbsMetropolis: [z]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSampling 4 chains for 1_000 tune and 1_000 draw iterations (4_000 + 4_000 draws total) took 13 seconds.\n/Users/philtpatton/miniforge3/envs/pymc_env/lib/python3.13/site-packages/arviz/stats/diagnostics.py:596: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in scalar divide\n  (between_chain_variance / within_chain_variance + num_samples - 1) / (num_samples)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean\nsd\nhdi_3%\nhdi_97%\nmcse_mean\nmcse_sd\ness_bulk\ness_tail\nr_hat\n\n\n\n\nbeta0\n-0.745\n0.240\n-1.215\n-0.306\n0.004\n0.003\n2883.0\n3314.0\n1.0\n\n\nbeta1\n2.788\n0.388\n2.098\n3.522\n0.007\n0.006\n2898.0\n2999.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha0\n1.398\n0.281\n0.883\n1.914\n0.006\n0.004\n2352.0\n2933.0\n1.0\n\n\nalpha1\n-3.093\n0.391\n-3.859\n-2.399\n0.008\n0.006\n2552.0\n2683.0\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the model recovers the simulated parameters.

    "text": "Automated Marginalization\nPyMC has a handy experimental feature called marginalize that automatically marginalizes out discrete latent states. This means that we can sample every parameter in the model with NUTS. This is not only faster than the hybrid sampler above, it also explores the parameter space more efficiently, which can be important for complex models or challenging datasets\nmarginalize is an experimental feature, and as such should be treated with some caution. Nevertheless, I have had success with it in the most common closed Bayesian population models (e.g., occupancy, capture-recapture, and distance sampling).

That means that the hybrid sampler took 13 times as long! While 13 seconds doesn’t seem like a lot, remember that this is simulated data and a rather simple model. Imagine if, say, the marginal model took five minutes to fit!",
