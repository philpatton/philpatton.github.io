title: "Dissertation Defense"
---

My dissertation defense is scheduled for **Friday, August 29th, 2025 at 2:30PM** Hawaiian Standard Time. Please join in-person if you can! The talk will be in the **Marine Science Building, Room 100**, on the University of Hawaiʻi, Mānoa campus. There will be a pau hana afterwards with drinks and snacks. 

Thanks to my former labmate, Dr. Brijonnay Madrigal, for putting together the following summary of the parking situation.

Zones 17 and 13 are the two locations you can park in (see map below). Zone 17 is in the structure and is a $5 flat-rate (pay at entrance kiosk) and you will just have to walk across Dole street and through lower campus to get to the Marine Sciences Building (MSB). It is about a 7-min walk from the parking structure. The other option is to park in Zone 13 in the green, visitor stalls which is closer to MSB but more expensive ($3 per 1/2 hour).
